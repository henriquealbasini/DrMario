# LDTS_T01_G06 - Dr. Lanterna

## Game Description

Dr. Lanterna is a puzzle arcade game based on the classic Dr. Mario, where the objective is to eradicate deadly viruses inside a bottle using colored vitamin capsules. The player must strategically align falling pills to match the colors of the viruses, eliminating them from the board.
The game challenges the player's quick thinking and planning, as the speed of the falling pills increases with each level, requiring precise movements and rotations to prevent the bottle from filling up.
This project was developed by Henrique Albasini Dias (up202407419@fe.up.pt) and Tomás Luís de Carvalho Rocha (up202405435@fe.up.pt) for LDTS 2025-26.
